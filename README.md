# Robotics-EIE3
Repo to hold the the code for Robotics course CO333 at Imperial College London taught by Andrew Davison: [Link](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/Robotics/)

### Contents

During several weeks we were encouraged to complete several challenges in hadrwarde and software calibration of our proposed robot.

The challanges included:

1. Building the robot and calibratiing it's odometry and PID controller [asssignment_1](/assignment_1).
2. Observe possible sensors and program avoidance manouvers based on ultrasound readings and bumpers [asssignment_2](/assignment_2) and [asssignment_3](/assignment_3).
3. Applying particle filter via Monte Carlo algorithm to navigate the robot through a a pre-defined maze [asssignment_4](/assignment_4)
4. Trying to learn a particular signature of a location to perform continuous localisation [asssignment_5](/assignment_5).
5. Final challenge in avoiding obstacles to reach a final destination [challenge](/challenge).
