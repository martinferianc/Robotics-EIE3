## Robotics Challenge: Obstacle avoidance
[**The handout**](../Resources/questions7.pdf)

The aim of the challenge was to navigate across an area filled with obstacles. The robot will
start with no knowledge of the positions of the bottles and will have to locate them with its sonar and plan a path to advance as far and as quickly as possible.

The robot started behind a start line marked on the floor, facing forwards, and there was a  parallel goal line 3m ahead.

The obstacles we used are soda bottles, which were considered as heavy vertical cylinders with radius 6cm.
